📌 Project Overview
This repository contains my Assignment 7, which implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

GAN: Trains a Generator and a Discriminator to create realistic MNIST digits.
VAE: Uses probabilistic encoding to generate MNIST-like images.
Based on the book: Deep Learning with TensorFlow 2 and Keras
